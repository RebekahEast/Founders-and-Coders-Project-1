<h2>Hobby Page</h2>
Hello! I'm a keen plant lover! And to share my dedication to the art of indoor plant care, I've been working on my hobby as a webpage. 

<br>The page was designed to fit any size and format that it is opened on. The colour palette is green, pink and grey - the best colour combos in my eyes ![eyes_1f440](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109970293/203339853-9e00d4d3-5fea-414b-99fd-0e0e5d62586f.png )




<h4>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h4>
1. LinkedIn won't open on a new page (<em>I'm already using target blank?</em>)<br>
2. numbers and bullets still lining up on the left - need to use a pseudo-class I think
