<h2>Hobby Page</h2>
Hello! I've been working on my hobby page. Below are some of the things I would look to improve as my learning and development continues.



<h4>Thing's I am still working on</h4>
- LinkedIn won't open on a new page (<em>I'm already using target blank?</em>)

- today's date (Java)
    
- numbers and bullets still lining up on the left
   * need to use a pseudo-class I think
