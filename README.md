Thing's I am still working on
- why wont LinkedIn open on a new page 
    * I'm already using target blank?


- today's date

- formatting the background on a phone
    * Currently using bakcground-size:auto. Also tried contain
    
- numbers and bullets still lining up on the left


- linking the topics back to the menu edits the URL and means you can't refresh
