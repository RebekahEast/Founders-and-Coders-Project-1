<p align = "center">Hello! I'm a keen plant lover! And to share my dedication to the art of indoor plant care, I've been working on my hobby as a webpage. </p>

<p align = "center">The page was designed to fit any size and format that it is opened on. The colour palette is green, pink and grey - the best colour combos in my eyes <img src="picture/eyes_1f440.png" width="25" height="25">.</p>

<p align = "center">The anchor links at the top take you to a different section of the webpage, acting as a quick key for the information. There is a grey background with swirly pictures, as well as a header and floating footer. Right at the bottom is the date and time while reading printed at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Key Learnings</h3></b>
<p align = "center">This project was fantastic! It allowed me to test out so many different HTML and CSS techniques that I hadn't used before/only learnt about. It was great to put them into practical knowledge</p>

<p align = "center">This project was also very useful for understanding Guthub (as I hadn't used it before!)</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p align = "center"><del> 1. LinkedIn won't open on a new page (<em>I'm already using target blank?</em>)</del> I met with a mentor at Founders & Coders who showed me the target blank needs to be next to the link and not next to the img src. <br>
2. I would like to have the date and time keep ticking once the page is loaded</p>
