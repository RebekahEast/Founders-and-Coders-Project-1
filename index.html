    <h2 name="plant_tips">Plant Care Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Caring for a plant isn't always the easiest!
        However, this website is here to make the care system
        a whole lot simpler! Research shows that plants can
        help you <a href="https://teachersinstitute.yale.edu/curriculum/units/files/00.06.02.pdf" target="_blank"> breathe better</a> 
        and <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/jeh/article/37/1/30/430948/An-Update-of-the-Literature-Supporting-the-Well" target="_blank">improve mental health</a> - so many other benefits!
        Without further ado, let's jump some quick and helpful little
        ways to care for your plants!
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Plants love stability! It is advised to choose a location for your plant before buying one, so that you can assess the conditions. 
        Plants will thrive within a similar and stable situation, so finding a spot with the right conditions is essential. 
        Remember that temperature will be important with this, as if this is constantly varying, the plant will struggle to adjust.
        Keep the plant conditions stable for a well grown and perfectly cared for plant.
        Don't move your plant too much, as this can disrupt the plant's balance!
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Some people think that all plants need a lot of sunlight. However, this isn't necessarily true! 
        Light is essential, but for some, more is often too much. Bright direct light is to be avoided for many species, expect cacti and succulents. 
        In the UK, a north facing window is a perfect place for a plant! Some plants will even love the low light of a bathroom!
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Light allows your plant to make food through photosynthesis. Every plant needs some light to survive, but this varies by species!
        If your plant is not getting enough light, the most common symptom would be yellowing and drooping of leaves. 
        It's a fine balance to get the right amount of light, and therefore it's important to choose a location for your plant based off the light level (<i>plus other factors!</i>). 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Sometimes, plants will be attacked by pests. They are usually quite easy to deal with, however they can also cause permanent damage to plants!
        Indoor plants specifically can be attacked by a variety of different pests, however the most common three are: 
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align: center">mealybugs</li>
            <li style="text-align: center">scaled insects</li>
            <li style="text-align: center">spider mites</li>
        </ul>
        Prevention is better than a cure - so keeping your plant nice and healthy is always the best way to stop these critters coming. However, there are ways to treat infestations.
    </p>
    <h6>Mealybugs</h6>
    <img src = "picture/mealybugs.jpeg" ALIGN="center" width = 300 alt="mealbybug parasites sat on a plant, lined up">
    <p>
        Mealybugs are small, sap-sucking insects, measuring around 4mm long. They can attack a wide range of foliage plants, being typically found along the stem 
        and in the leaves of plants.
        <br><br> 
        The best way to control mealybugs is to keep the plant clean and sterile. You can physically remove the mealybugs, as well as their eggs. 
        Another option could be to use a biological control - for example ladybirds (<i>Cryptolaemus montrouzieri</i>)! - who will eat the mealybugs and not cause further plant damage.
    </p>
    <h6>Scaled Insects</h6>
    <img src = "picture/scaled-insects.jpeg" ALIGN="center" width = 300 alt="scaled insect parasites sat on a plant stem, lined up and smaller than mealybugs">
    <p>
        These are an interesting one! Although the young version can move freely, the adults are fully stationary on the plant, which are armoured and large. 
        Scaled insects don't tend to be picky eaters, and will munch through any indoor plant, and will also move across from plant to plant - causing damage very quickly!
        <br><br>When a colony of fully armoured scales are established on a plant, you would see many barnacle like encrustions on the surface of the plant. 
        So how can you control these?! Once established, this can be hard - the hard shells make them chemical and water resistant. The best bet is to remove them during the young stage!
    </p>
    <h6>Spider Mites</h6>
    <img src = "picture/spider-mites.webp" ALIGN="center" width = 300 alt="plant with spider webs across it and small spider mite parasites dotted around">
    <p>
        A small relative of the spider, this is the most damaging pest to be found on indoor plants. They feed by puncturing leaves, and have a quick life cycle, meaning the population can explode quickly. 
        They love warm and dry conditions! Biological control can be used for spider mites, an example being a predatory mite.<br><br>The physical cleaning is also effective. Remove any webbing as soon as it is seen! 
        You can also move the location of the plant to an area less warm and dry, like a bathroom or kitchen - but think about what the plant wants first!
    </p>
    <h4>4. Dreaded Droop</h4>
    <p>
        Droopy leaves that hang limply from the stem of the plant show that the whole plant is in distress!
        A healthy plant will be able to hold it's own weight with the use of water tension in the stem. Therefore limp leaves are not a good sign!
        They can be caused by a number of reasons, and a range of external factors. With some playing around, and trial and error, you can prevent droopiness and restore your plant to full (and tall!) health.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Many people think the best way to nurse a wilted plant back to life is to give it a drink, that's not always the case.
        While having an underwatered plant could be a major cause for leaf drooping, there are other reasons too why this might not be the immediate case! Although underwatering is actually the number one case for a droopy leaf,
        the second most common case would be overwatering your beloved plant - so there's a fine line on what's right and what's wrong here! The most important thing to do when leaves droop is to check the soil and assess if your plant
        has had a <em>little too much</em> or <em>a little too little</em> to drink! Finding this out puts you on the right track to play detective and solve the droopy leaf issue!

    <p>
        The golden rule for watering a houseplant is to check the soil before adding more water! If it's still damp, give it a few more days, and if it's <b>dry as a bone!</b> then water that baby up.<br><br>
        The time of year can make a difference, as well - because we didn't want to make it hard enough already! Many houseplants grow more during the spring and summer, but not as much in the fall and winter. 
        If you notice less growth than usual, ease up on how much water you give your plants until they start growing more again. <br><br> Overall, it's a fine art to master - and takes some trial and error to adjust. 
        Struggling with keeping up on the watering, we get you! Don't fret, there are apps out there to help play a part in keeping track. For our personal favourite, try 
        <a href="https://getplanta.com/" target="_blank"> Planta.</a><br><br>
        You can try something called bottom watering! This is a method of watering plants from the bottom up. When you water potted plants from the bottom up, their roots get stronger because they're always growing directly down toward the moisture. 
        Plus, you'll always know the moisture in the potting soil reaches all the way to the bottom of your plants' roots. When you do it correctly, this method is suitable for any potted plant, both indoors and out.

    <h2 name="first-time">Easiest Plants for First Timers</h2>
    <p>
       Picking an easy plant for first timers is important! As you can see from the above, plant care isn't always plain sailing! When selecting a low maintanance plant, look for plants with deep green leaves and these
       will thrive better in low light conditions and will need less water than other plants. <br> We've compiled a short list below of what we consider to be the top 5 plants for new starters or people less green thumbed out there.
       <ul class="center">
        <li style="text-align: center">Peace Lily - a diverse and beautiful plant which easily tells you when it needs more water</li>
        <li style="text-align: center">Snake Plant - striking and makes a great feature, also very hard and needs very little maintanance</li>
        <li style="text-align: center">Aloe Vera - incredibly versatile with the ability to soothe sore skin. This plant needs low watering in general</li>
        <li style="text-align: center">Cactus - we all know how little watering a cactus needs (<em>just make sure not to overwater!</em>). They look great too!</li>
        <li style="text-align: center">Spider Plant - cute leaves with a whimsical feel to it, this plant is a great beginner option</li>
