    <h2>Plant Care Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Caring for a plant isn't always the easiest!
        However, this website is here to make the care system
        a whole lot simpler! Research shows that plants can

        Without further ado, let's jump some quick and helpful little
        ways to care for your plants!
    </p>
    <h3>1. Stability</h3>
    <p>
        Plants love stability! It is advised to choose a location for your plant before buying one, so that you can assess the conditions. 
        Plants will thrive within a similar and stable situation, so finding a spot with the right conditions is essential. 
        Remember that temperature will be important with this, as if this is constantly varying, the plant will struggle to adjust.
        Keep the plant conditions stable for a well grown and perfectly cared for plant.
        Don't move your plant too much, as this can disrupt the plant's balance!

    <h3>2. Light Levels</h3>
    <h4>Too much direct sunlight</h4>
    <p>
        Some people think that all plants need a lot of sunlight. However, this isn't necessarily true! 
        Light is essential, but for some, more is often too much. Bright direct light is to be avoided for many species, expect cacti and succulents. 
        In the UK, a north facing window is a perfect place for a plant! Some plants will even love the low light of a bathroom!
    </p>
    <h4>Too little sunlight</h4>
    <p>
        Light allows your plant to make food through photosynthesis. Every plant needs some light to survive, but this varies by species!
        If your plant is not getting enough light, the most common sympton would be yellowing and drooping of leaves. 
        It's a fine balance to get the right amount of light, and therefore it's important to choose a location for your plant based off the light level (<i>plus other factors!</i>). 
    </p>
    <h3>3. Pests</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes, plants will be attacked by pests. They are usually quite easy to deal with, however they can also cause permanent damage to plants!
        Indoor plants specifically can be attacked by a variety of different pests, however the most common three are: 
        <ul>
            <li>mealybugs</li>
            <li>scaled insects</li>
            <li>spider mites</li>
        </ul>
        Prevention is better than a cure - so keeping your plant nice and healthy is always the best way to stop these critters coming. However, there are ways to treat infestations.
    </p>
    <h4>Mealybugs</h4>
    <p>
        Mealybugs are small, sap-sucking insects, measuring around 4mm long. They can attack a wide range of foliage plants, being typically found along the stem 
        and in the leaves of plants. The best way to control mealybugs is to keep the plant clean and sterile. You can physically remove the mealybugs, as well as their eggs. 
        Another option could be to use a biological control - for example ladybirds (<i>Cryptolaemus montrouzieri</i>)! - who will eat the mealbugs and not cause further plant damage.
    </p>
    <h4>Scaled Insects</h4>
    <p>
        These are an interesting one! Although the young version can move freely, the adults are fully stationary on the plant, which are armoured and large. 
        Scaled insects don't tend to be picky eaters, and will munch through any indoor plant, and will also move across from plant to plant - causing damage very quickly!
        When a colony of fully armoured scales are established on a plant, you would see many barnacle like encrustions on the surface of the plant. 
        So how can you control these?! Once established, this can be hard - the hard shells make them chemical and water resistant. The best bet is to remove them during the young stage!
    </p>
    <h4>Spider Mites</h4>
    <p>
        A small relative of the spider, this is the most damaging pest to be found on indoor plants. They feed by puncturing leaves, and have a quick life cycle, meaning the population can explode quickly. 
        They love warm and dry conditions! Biological control can be used for spider mites, an example being a predatory mite. The physical cleaning is also effective. Remove any webbing as soon as it is seen! 
        You can also move the location of the plant to an area less warm and dry, like a bathroom or kitchen - but think about what the plant wants first!
