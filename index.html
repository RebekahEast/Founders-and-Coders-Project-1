        Without further ado, let's jump some quick and helpful little
        ways to care for your plants!
    </p>
    <h3>1. Stability</h3>
    <p>
        Plants love stability! It is advised to choose a location for your plant before buying one, so that you can assess the conditions. 
        Plants will thrive within a similar and stable situation, so finding a spot with the right conditions is essential. 
        Remember that temperature will be important with this, as if this is constantly varying, the plant will struggle to adjust.
        Keep the plant conditions stable for a well grown and perfectly cared for plant.
        Don't move your plant too much, as this can disrupt the plant's balance!

    <h3>2. Light Levels</h3>
    <h4>Too much direct sunlight</h4>
    <p>
        Some people think that all plants need a lot of sunlight. However, this isn't necessarily true! 
        Light is essential, but for some, more is often too much. Bright direct light is to be avoided for many species, expect cacti and succulents. 
        In the UK, a north facing window is a perfect place for a plant! Some plants will even love the low light of a bathroom!
    </p>
    <h4>Too little sunlight</h4>
    <p>
        Light allows your plant to make food through photosynthesis. Every plant needs some light to survive, but this varies by species!
        If your plant is not getting enough light, the most common sympton would be yellowing and drooping of leaves. 
        It's a fine balance to get the right amount of light, and therefore it's important to choose a location for your plant based off the light level (<i>plus other factors!</i>).
